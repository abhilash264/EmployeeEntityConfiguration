# EmployeeEntityConfiguration
So here is an Employee's Attributes configuration where I have used Spring-Boot to have four basic pillars :- i.e Entity,Model,Controller & Service .
The Service(business logic) have functions like to add the data to the data-base (HashMap here) as well to get the data more specifically the CRUD operations.
Here I have used Postman to test my APIs and I have also used Maven to inject dependencies.
